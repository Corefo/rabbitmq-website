## RabbitMQ 3.8.3-beta.2

RabbitMQ `3.8.3-beta.2` is a preview of a maintenance release.

### Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [**requires Erlang/OTP 21.3**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.
`22.x` series is recommended.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang `21.3.x` and `22.x`.

### Compatibility Notes

#### Upgrading to Erlang 21.x or Later Versions

When upgrading to this release from `3.7.6` or an older version, extra care has to be taken.

Since CLI tools from RabbitMQ releases older than 3.7.7 will fail on Erlang 21 or later,
RabbitMQ **must be upgraded at the same time as Erlang**. Alternatively the node can be upgraded
to `3.7.18` first, then Erlang 21.x or 22.x, then to RabbitMQ 3.8.x.

#### Upgrade Doc Guides and Change Log

See [3.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.0) upgrade
and compatibility notes first if upgrading from an earlier release.

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for general documentation on upgrades
and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) for release notes of other releases.

## Changes

### Core Server

#### Bug Fixes

 * Reduced scheduled GC activity in connection socket writer to one run per 1 GiB of data transferred,
   with an option to change the value or disable scheduled run entirely. More frequent binary heap GC runs seem
   unneccesary on Erlang 22.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common#343](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-common/pull/343)

 * Syslog client is now started even when Syslog logging is configured only for some log sinks.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#2044](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/2044)

### CLI Tools

#### Enhancements

 * New health checks that can be used to determine if it's a good moment to shut down a node for an upgrade.

   ``` sh
   # Exits with a non-zero code if target node hosts master replica of at least one queue
   # that has out-of-sync mirror.
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_mirror_sync_critical

   # Exits with a non-zero code if one or more quorum queues will lose online quorum
   # should target node be shut down
   rabbitmq-diagnostics check_if_node_is_quorum_critical
   ```

### Management Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * Consumer section on individual page was unintentionally hidden.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#758](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/issues/758)

#### Enhancements

 * An undocumented "automagic login" feature on the login form was removed.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management#748](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/748)


### Kubernetes Peer Discovery Plugin

#### Enhancements

   The plugin will now notify [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#event-v1-core) of node startup and peer stop/unavailability events.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s#61](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-peer-discovery-k8s/pull/61)


### Federation Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * "Command" operations such as binding propagation now use a separate channel for all links,
   preventing latency spikes for asynchronous operations (such as message publishing)
   (a head-of-line blocking problem).

   Contributed by Grigory Starinkin.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation#97](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation/pull/97)


### Auth Backend OAuth 2 Plugin

 * Additional scopes can be fetched from a predefined JWT token field. Those scopes will be combined
   with the standard scopes field.

   Contributed by @papugamichal.

   GitHub issue: [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2#41](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-oauth2/pull/41)


### Trust Store Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * HTTPS certificate provider will not longer terminate if upstream service response contains
   invalid JSON.
