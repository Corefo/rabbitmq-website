# Windows Quirks

We aim to make RabbitMQ a first-class citizen on
Windows. However, sometimes there are circumstances beyond our
control that can introduce quirky behaviour. This page documents
them.

## Cannot install to a path with non-ASCII characters

RabbitMQ will fail to start with the error that reads

<pre class="lang-text">
RabbitMQ: Erlang machine stopped instantly (distribution name conflict?)
</pre>

when installed to a path with non-ASCII characters in it.
This is because we need to pass the location of the compiled Erlang files to the Erlang VM.
It expects input in UTF-8, but the console will typically use some other encoding.

### Workarounds

<ul>
  <li>
    Override <code>RABBITMQ_BASE</code> to point to a directory
    that only has ASCII characters and <em>re-install</em> the
    service.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the file <code>rabbitmq-server.bat</code> and change the
    line "<code>set TDP0=%~dp0</code>" to "
    <code>set TDP0=%~dps0</code>". This will use short paths (the
    infamous <code>C:\PROGRA~1</code>) everywhere.
  </li>
</ul>

## rabbitmqctl displays or parses non-ASCII characters incorrectly

Similarly, [RabbitMQ CLI tools](/cli.html) will expect command line
parameters to be encoded in UTF-8, and display strings as
UTF-8. The console will instead provide and expect some
country-specific encoding.

### Workarounds

<ul>
  <li>
    On recent versions of Windows, issue the command "
    <code>chcp 65001</code>" before using <code>rabbitmqctl</code> to force
    the console to use UTF-8. (Beware: on older versions
    including Windows XP this will cause the console to silently
    fail to run any batch file at all!) <em>or</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid using non-ASCII characters in object names <em>or</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the <a href="management.html">management plugin</a> instead of
    <code>rabbitmqctl</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

## Installing as a non-administrator user leaves <a href="/clustering.html#erlang-cookie">.erlang.cookie</a>
in the wrong place


This makes it impossible to use [CLI tools](/cli.html) and cluster nodes.

### Workarounds

<ul>
  <li>
    Run the installer as an administrator <em>or</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy the file <code>.erlang.cookie</code> manually
    from <code>%SystemRoot%</code> or
    <code>%SystemRoot%\system32\config\systemprofile</code>
    to <code>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

## <a id="computername-vs-hostname" class="anchor" href="#computername-vs-hostname">COMPUTERNAME is different from HOSTNAME</a>

Older versions of RabbitMQ calculated the node name using the `COMPUTERNAME`
environment variable, which is always upper-case. Later versions of RabbitMQ
use `HOSTNAME` which may be lowercase. If you are upgrading from an old
(pre-`3.6.0`) version of RabbitMQ to a current one and see [the issue described
here](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/issues/1568), you should set
a system-wide environment variable named `RABBITMO_NODENAME` with the following
value:

```
rabbit@ALL_CAPS_HOSTNAME
```

Then, RabbitMQ will continue to use the all-caps hostname and your upgrade will
succeed.
